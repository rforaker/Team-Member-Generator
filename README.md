# Team-Member-Generator

## Description

In this project I created a CLI tool that dynamically creates an HTML webpage populated with information cards from each type of given employee. Prompts are dynamic based on what role you select. I struggled a lot with unit tests and unfortunately was not able to get them working properly and will have to review.
